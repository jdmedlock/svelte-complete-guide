Solutions to Svelte.js - The Complete Guide course

## Overview

These are my solutions to the [Svelet.js - The Complete Guide (incl. Sapper.js)](https://www.udemy.com/course/sveltejs-the-complete-guide/) 
course by Maximilian Schwarzm√ºller. 

## Organization

Since assignments are at the end of each section I've chosen to create a
unique branch for each section. This will allow them to be referenced and
revisited later with no additional information included from later sections.

### Branches

| Course Section | Branch | Assignment |
|:---------------|:-------|:-----------|
| Section 2: Base Syntax & Core Features | feature/section-2 | - Add an input field that allows users to enter a course goal.<br/> - Output the user input in a h1 tag.<br/> - Color the output red (e.g. by adding a class) if it contains at least one exclamation mark.<br/> - Put the h1 tag + output into a separate component to which you pass the user input |
