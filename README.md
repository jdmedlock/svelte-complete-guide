Solutions to Svelte.js - The Complete Guide course

## Overview

These are my solutions to the [Svelet.js - The Complete Guide (incl. Sapper.js)](https://www.udemy.com/course/sveltejs-the-complete-guide/) 
course by Maximilian Schwarzm√ºller. 

## Organization

Since assignments are at the end of each section I've chosen to create a
unique branch for each section. This will allow them to be referenced and
revisited later with no additional information included from later sections.

### Branches

| Course Section | Branch |
|:---------------|:-------|
| Section 2: Base Syntax & Core Features | feature/section-2 |
